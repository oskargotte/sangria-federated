## How does it work?

The library adds [Apollo's Federation Specification](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/federation-spec/)
on top of the provided sangria graphql schema. And to make it possible to use *_Any* as a scalar,
the library upgrades the marshaller used in the user application too.

## Caution ðŸš¨ðŸš¨

The library upgrades the marshaller too, by making map values scalars (e.g. json objects as 
scalars). This if not treated with caution, can lead to security issues as discussed [here](http://www.petecorey.com/blog/2017/06/12/graphql-nosql-injection-through-json-types/).
